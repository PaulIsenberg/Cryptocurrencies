# Cryptocurrencies
The task for this challenge was to use Unsupervised Machine Learning to prepare and visualize data on traded cryptocurrencies.
After cleaning the data I applied PCA analysis to identify the top 3 Pricipal Components.
Then I used an Elbow Curve to determine the appropriate number of clusters, which was 4.
Next, I ran the PC data through K Means to predict clusters.
Lastly, I presented 3 visualizations to support the analysis.
